# aibill-issue
This is a repository created to report errors or bugs about aibill.
If you leave issues related to aibill here, the developer will be happy to answer them.

However, on the issue page, abusive language, swearing at a specific person for no reason, or issues containing content that may make other people uncomfortable may be deleted without notice. So, I would appreciate it if you could register an issue with kind words. Developers are people too, so if you leave an issue with offensive language, the developer doesn't want to respond.
